    <div class="review">
      <p>The Star Wars franchise has 9 main movies and 2 spinoffs for a total of 11 movies. The 9 main movies are separated into 3 equal trilogies and the other 2 spinoffs fit loosely within. For no particular reason at all I'll be ranking them here today for you to read. Thank you.</p>

      <h4><strong>S Tier</strong></h4>
      <p>At S tier, I've chosen the two undeniably best movies of the franchise. Firstly, A New Hope. The original film that started it all. The catalyst for the entire story that would unfold, A New Hope is a film that's true to its name and inspires hope in the story it tells. Below is my favorite scene from the movie.</p>
      <p>Secondly on the list, we have Revenge of the Sith. This film deserves an S tier rating for how well it captures the downfall of Anakin and finally gives the prequel trilogy a good name.</p>
      <h4><strong>A Tier</strong></h4>
      <p>On the A list, we have both the final movies in the original trilogy and one of the spinoffs. Both of the original trilogies give a fair ending to the story first established in A New Hope.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Rogue One also competes highly with these movies. Rogue One first came out in 2016 and was pretty much a flop at the box office. However, in my opinion, it's a worthwhile watch and would surprise many people.</p>
      <h4><strong>B Tier</strong></h4>
      <p>B tier consists of just The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker. The latter of the two was actually a decent change of pace from what the sequel trilogy was aiming to be. However, both seem to suffer from lots of plot holes to just plain lazy writing at times.</p>
      <h4><strong>C Tier</strong></h4>
      <p>On the C list, we have the other two prequel films not yet mentioned, those being The Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones. Not much to say about these movies, they're just boring in my opinion. I also included Solo at C tier. In my opinion, the movie is actually fun to watch but doesn't stand well to criticism.</p>
      <h4><strong>D Tier</strong></h4>
      <p>Finally, we have D tier, and standing alone at this rank is The Last Jedi. With so many plot holes, so many conveniences, and liberties taken, it is easily the worst thing Disney has done to Star Wars. Easily deserves D tier and probably worse.</p>
